# ECO MAP EDITOR

A 2D Map Editor with [Entity Component Systems](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/understanding-component-entity-systems-r3013) in mind.
It supports Tiles, as well as free positioned images, animations and entities.
This description will soon be filled with more information.

It uses the NetBeans Platform as well as LibGDX. Some JavaFX is currently in use, but soon will be replaced with Swing since it causes too long loading times and synchronization issues.
